# Machine Learning Trends Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of research papers, mainly focused on machine learning trends. The papers are collected from various events and have been processed into a CSV file which can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/nips-papers?select=papers.csv)

## Project Overview

With the rise of machine learning in recent years, it's critical to stay updated with the latest trends. The number of research papers in this field is growing exponentially, each introducing a novel technique or enhancement. This project aims to analyze these research papers using natural language processing methods to understand the evolving trends in machine learning and other related fields.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- Jupyter notebooks containing the detailed exploratory analysis and LDA modeling.
- Python scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Insights

We performed:

- Initial exploration of the CSV file to understand the data structure.
- Natural language processing of the paper contents to extract key topics.
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis of research titles to identify main topics and trends.

## Requirements

This codebase is written in Python 3.x. Additional packages required are:

- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- gensim
- matplotlib
- seaborn
